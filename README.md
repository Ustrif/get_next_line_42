GET_NEXT_LINE

The get_next_line project took my time so much. I tried to finish my project for 5 times. At the end, it has finished.

To use:

#include "get_next_line_bonus.h"

get_next_line(fd);

To compile:

cc get_next_line_bonus.c get_next_line_utils_bonus.c main.c -Wall -Wextra -Werror -D BUFFER_SIZE="CHANGE_ME" -o my_program && clear && ./my_program
